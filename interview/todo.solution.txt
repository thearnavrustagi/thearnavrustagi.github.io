input.Value - Should be input.value (wrong capitalization)
if (taskText = "") - Assignment instead of comparison (should be == or ===)
tasks.Push() - Should be tasks.push() (wrong method name)
deleteBtn.onclick = deleteTask() - Immediate function execution instead of assignment (should be deleteTask without ())
checkbox.onChange - Should be checkbox.onchange (case sensitivity)
li.append(DELETEBTN) - Wrong variable name (should be deleteBtn) and capitalization
tasks[index].completed - Trying to set property on string (tasks array contains strings, not objects)
li.TextContent - Should be li.textContent (wrong capitalization)
task.splice() - Wrong array name (should be tasks)
addTask in event listener - Missing () so function won't execute
Bonus bug: Delete button won't work properly because this context is lost
Bonus bug: toggleComplete will fail because textContent includes button text
