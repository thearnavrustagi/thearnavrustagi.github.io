            This was a small project I undertook to understand fractals, scipy and numpy for scientific computation, and made several fractal programs including Koch's structures, Fibonacci fractals et. al.<br><br>
            Out of all the fractals I made mandala fractals were the one which were loved because of the innate beauty and how pleasing they were to the eye, the algorithm was fairly easy but yielded beautiful results<br><br>
            <ul class="project-content" style="color:#fff;">
                <li>First take a point in the center</li>
                <li>Create <code>N</code> points arround the starting point</li>
                <li>Repeat the last step <code>I</code> times where <code>I</code> is the number of iterations</li>
                <li>Interpolate all the points using <code>voronoi</code> or <code>delaunay</code> interpolation</li>
            </ul>
