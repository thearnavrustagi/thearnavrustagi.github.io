                This was the first proper video game which I completed and put out, I mean calling it complete is like calling medusa beautiful, but I was proud of it<br><br>
                It was a mixure of bullethell aspects inspired from Enter the Gungeon and Eli married with procedural map generation using the algorithm <code>Random Walk</code><br><br>
                Now I have learnt better ways to generate maps due to experiments with fractals but this game still holds a place in my heart
