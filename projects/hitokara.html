            This was a website created by me due to the lack of good karaoke resources, It was only developed till the beta version. The goal behind the website is that once you sing it automatically tells you how to improve what you have sung, by using advanced audio analysis tools such as FFT, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, tempo detection and detection of the fundamental frequency.<br><br>
            The project was initially built using python3, javascript, HTML/CSS and used tensorflow, pyaudio and librosa extensively, with the youtube-api to search for the songs and use them, all the data was saved in a SQL database.<br><br>
            Eventhough the first version worked, I am planning to reimplement hitokara with renewed technology and better algorithmic backing and an even more beautiful UI/UX<br><br>
