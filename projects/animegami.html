            A website which curated the anime episodes, the manga chapters, and the opening music,
            all in one spot !

        <p class="project-content animegami">
            This website was built for personal use so that I could have the anime, manga and music all in one spot as it was a pain remembering 5 different pirated links and skipping through the ads<br><br>
            Out of mere inconvenience I whipped up a website which catered to all these needs using apis and automation, the beauty was that the program ran without a backend !<br><br>
            Anyways the site's sources were not legal and its API not official, so I never advertised it.
