            An interpreted language with the freedom of python3 but ideas from C
        </p>
        <p class="project-content musket-accent">
            I love curly braces, I love type safety, I love pointers, I love C, but then again I love the freedom that python gives me, I love the shortcuts python has, I love how I have everything I could ever need in python, but the control that C gives me on my memory is intoxicating.<br><br>
            Split between these two language giants I came up with an idea to mix these two and create my own interpreted language, MUSKET!<br><br>
            It worked but had a lot of scope of improvement which is something I wish to pursue later, with added options for a language to code itself !
